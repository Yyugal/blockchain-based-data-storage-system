# blockchain-based-data-storage-system
I developed a secure data storage system on Remix IDE. This project utilizes smart contracts to enable safe file uploads, controlled access sharing, and transparent user permissions. The system is designed to ensure data privacy and provide efficient access control for users. Key features include robust encryption for data protection, seamless user experience, and scalability for handling large volumes of files.
